This port depends on the system libc (libc.dylib).
Watch out for libc-related bugs!

To build SubC on macOS >= 10.15 you need Clang and the Xcode command line
tools, which you can install with:

    $ xcode-select --install

Make sure the /Library/Developer/CommandLineTools/SDKs/MacOSX.sdk/
directory exists.

To build for a different macOS version start by changing paths and options
in src/sys.h (symlink to src/targets/darwin-x86-64/sys-darwin-x86-64.h).
